# The Spectacular Code Quiz

## Description

For this project, we were tasked with building a short, interactive quiz about code using what we'd learned in Javascript. It would heavily rely on building functions, adding event listeners, and utilizing local storage among many other elements.

Once you've clicked start the questions will appear one by one after the page. If you get answer correct, you will be greeted with a "Good Job", but if you get an answer wrong you'll lose ten seconds from your score and see a depressing "WRONG".

After you've either run out of time or have answered all the questions, you will have the option of entering your initials to save your high score! If you choose to do so, you'll be taken to the High Scores page with a notice of your score.
